- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maanith
- 👀 I’m a New Media Designer interested in, creative technology, public art, space design, installations, and out-of-the-box speculative design ideas.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about creative tech, projection mapping, simulations and dynamic sensor-based interactions in design projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research and development projects, creative tech initiatives, and speculative design concepts.
- 📫 You can reach me on my linkdin as well as on my instagram. I check them every weekend.
- 😄 Fun fact: I’ve performed in a theatre workshop, where I didn't even knew the language and it's one of the most memorable experiences of my life.
